This tool requests and decodes the following-error from Leadshine ES-D508 closed loop stepper motor drives. This work was done to better integrate the Leadshine drive into LinuxCNC. The software has only been tested with a Leadshine ES-D508 drive connected to ES-M32320 motors. No other combination should be assumed to work. In fact, even this combination should be assumed not to work. This software is provided as a reference and use of it is at your risk.
